- **Inventory System**: Collect items and manage an inventory that affects gameplay and story outcomes.
- **Storyline**: Experience a rich narrative that unfolds through dialogues, quests, and environmental storytelling.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: JavaFX or Swing (for creating the game interface)
- **Game Development Libraries**: LibGDX 
- **Development Tools**: IntelliJ IDEA (for coding and debugging)
